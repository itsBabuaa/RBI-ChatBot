NBFCs in \\nthe lowest layer shall be known as NBFC s-Base Layer (NBFC s-BL). NBFCs in middle \\nlayer and upper layer shall be known as NBFCs-Middle Layer (NBFCs-ML) and NBFCs-\\nUpper Layer (NBFC s-UL), respectively. The Top Layer is ideally expected to be empty \\nand will be known as NBFCs-Top Layer (NBFCs-TL).  \\nDetails of NBFCs populating the various layers shall be as prescribed in paragraphs 2.2 \\nto paragraphs 2.6 below: \\n2.2 Base Layer  \\nThe Base Layer shall comprise of (a) non- deposit taking NBFCs below the asset size of \\n₹1,000 crore and (b) NBFCs undertaking the following activities  - (i) NBFC-Peer to Peer \\nLending Platform (NBFC -P2P), (ii) NBFC -Account Aggregator (NBFC -AA), (iii) Non -\\nOperative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) and (iv) NBFC not availing public funds \\nand not having any customer interface\\n2. \\n2.3 Middle Layer \\nThe Middle Layer shall consist of (a) all deposit taking NBFCs (NBFCs-D), irrespective of \\nasset size, (b) non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of ₹1,000 crore and above and \\n(c) NBFCs undertaking the followi ng activities (i) Standalone Primary Dealer (SPD), (ii) \\nInfrastructure Debt Fund- Non-Banking Financial Company (IDF-NBFC), (iii) Core \\n \\n1 Vide circular DOR.CRE.REC.No.60/03.10.001/2021-22 dated October 22, 2021. \\n2 Public funds and customer interface as defined in these Directions.'),\n",

The \\ntop ten eligible NBFCs in terms of their asset size shall always reside in the upper layer, \\nirrespective of any other factor. \\n2.5 Top Layer  \\nThe Top Layer will ideally remain empty. This layer can get populated if the Reserve Bank \\nis of the opinion that there is a substantial increase in the potential systemic risk from \\nspecific NBFCs in the Upper Layer. Such NBFCs shall move to the Top Layer from the \\nUpper Layer. \\n2.6 Categorisation of NBFCs carrying out specific activity  \\nAs the regulatory structure envisages scale based as well as activity -based regulation, \\nthe following prescriptions shall apply in respect of the NBFCs. \\n2.6.1 NBFC-P2P, NBFC -AA, NOFHC and NBFC not availing public funds and not \\nhaving any customer interface will always remain in  the Base Layer of the regulatory \\nstructure. \\n2.6.2 NBFC-D, CIC, NBFC-IFC and HFC will be included in Middle Layer or the Upper \\nLayer (and not in the Base layer), as the case may be. SPD and IDF -NBFC will always \\nremain in the Middle Layer. \\n2.6.3 The remaining NBFCs, vi z., NBFC -Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC -\\nICCs), NBFC -Micro Finance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs), NBFC -Factors and Mortgage \\nGuarantee Companies (MGCs) could lie in any of the layers of the regulatory structure \\ndepending on the parameters of the scale based regulatory framework. \\n2.6.4 Government owned NBFCs shall be placed in the Base Layer or Middle Layer, \\nas the case may be. They will not be placed in the Upper Layer till further notice. \\n2.7 References to NBFC-ND, NBFC-ND-SI and NBFC-D  \\nFrom October 01, 2022, all references to NBFC-ND (i.e., non-systemically important non-\\ndeposit taking NBFC) shall mean NBFC-BL and all references to NBFC -D (i.e., deposit'),\n",

However, NBFC-D, within the Group, if any, shall also be governed under the \\nNon-\\nBanking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank) Direction, \\n2016. Illustrative examples are provided in paragraph 136 of the Directions.  \\n2.8.3 Statutory Auditors are required to certify the asset size (as on March 31) of all the \\nNBFCs in the Gr oup every year. The certificate shall be furnished to the Department of \\nSupervision of the Reserve Bank under whose jurisdiction the NBFCs are registered. \\n2.8.4 Provisions contained in paragraph 2.8 shall not be applicable for classifying an \\nNBFC in the Upper Layer.  \\n2.9 Criteria for deciding NBFC-ML status \\n2.9.1 Once an NBFC reaches an asset size of ₹1,000 crore or above, it shall be subject \\nto the regulatory requirements as per Section III  of these Directions, despite not having \\nsuch assets as on the date of last balance sheet. All such non-deposit taking NBFCs shall \\ncomply with the regulations/directions issued to NBFC s-ML from time to time, as and \\nwhen they attain an asset size of ₹1,000 crore, irrespective of the date on which such \\nsize is attained. \\n2.9.2 In a dynamic environment, the asset size of a NBFCs can fall below ₹1,000 crore \\nin a given month, which may be due to temporary fluctuations and not due to actual \\n \\n3 Existing NBFC-ND-SI having asset size of ₹500 crore and above but below ₹1000 crore (except that necessarily featuring in Middle \\nLayer) will be known as NBFC-BL. \\n4 Including NBFCs which will always remain in Base Layer – NBFC-P2P, NBFC-AA, NOFHC and NBFC without public funds and \\ncustomer interface.'),\n",

A jurisdiction, whose name does not appear in the two aforementioned lists, shall be referred to as a \\nFATF compliant jurisdiction. \\n10 Potential voting power could arise from instruments that are convertible into equity, other instruments with contingent voting rights, \\ncontractual arrangements, etc. that grant investors voting rights (including contingent voting rights) in the future. In such  cases, it \\nshould be ensured that new investments from FATF non-compliant jurisdictions are less than both (i) 20 percent of the existing voting \\npowers and (ii) 20 percent of existing and potential voting powers assuming those potential voting rights have materialised.'),\n",

However, certain transactions of NBFCs involving AIFs have raised regulatory \\nconcerns. These transactions entail substitution of direct loan exposure of NBFCs to \\nborrowers, with indirect exposure through investments in units of AIFs.

Such downstream \\ninvestments shall exclude investments in equity shares of the debtor company of the \\nNBFC, but shall include all other investments, including investment in hybrid instruments.  \\n \\nExplanation: For this purpose, the debtor company shall mean any company to which the \\nNBFC currently has or previously had a loan or investment exposure anytime during the \\npreceding 12 months.  \\n(ii) If an AIF scheme, in which NBFC is already an investor, m akes a downstream \\ninvestment in any such debtor company, then the NBFC shall liquidate its investment in \\nthe scheme within 30 days from the date of such downstream investment by the AIF. \\nNBFCs shall forthwith arrange to advise the AIFs suitably in the matter. \\n(iii) In case NBFCs are not able to liquidate their investments within the above-prescribed \\ntime limit, they shall make 100 percent provision on such investments. Provisioning shall \\nbe required only to the extent of investment by the NBFC in the AIF scheme which is \\nfurther invested by the AIF in the debtor company, and not on the entire investment of the \\nNBFC in the AIF scheme. \\n \\n(2) In addition, investment by NBFCs in the subordinated units of any AIF scheme with a \\n‘priority distribution model’ shall be subject to full deduction from capital funds of NBFCs.  \\nSuch deduction from capital shall take place equally from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\\n \\n \\n \\n19 Vide circular DOR.STR.REC.58/21.04.048/2023-24 dated December 19, 2023 and circular DOR.STR.REC.85/21.04.048/2023-24 \\ndated March 27, 2024.'),\n",

Potential future exposures shall be based on 'effective' rather than 'apparent \\nnotional amounts'.

The reason for this is that \\noffsetting contracts in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower \\npotential future exposure as well as lower current exposure. \\n85.4.4 Definitions and general terminology \\n(i) Current Exposure is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or portfolio \\nof transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default \\nof the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in \\nbankruptcy. Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost (RC). \\n(ii) Netting Set is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \\nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is recognised for \\nregulatory capital purposes. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceabl e \\nbilateral netting arrangement that is recognised for regulatory capital purposes should be \\ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules. \\n85.4.5 Requirement for recognition of Bilateral Netting Contract \\n(i) NBFCs may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation between \\nsuch NB FC and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is \\nautomatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value \\ndate, legally substituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations. \\n(ii) NBFCs may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilateral netting \\nnot covered in (i), including other forms of novation. \\n(iii) In both cases (i) and (ii), NBFCs will need to satisfy that it has: \\n(a) A netting contract or agreement with the counterparty which creates a single legal \\nobligation, covering all included transactions, such that the NB FCs would have either a \\nclaim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-\\nto-market values of included individual transactions in the event a counterparty fails to \\nperform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar \\ncircumstances;'),\n",

How \\nwill these NBFCs be classified in various layers? \\nExplanation – On a standalone basis, as per SBR Regulatory Framework,  \\n•  HFCs and IFCs will, by default, be included in the Middle Layer but may move to the \\nUpper Layer based on the supervisory filtering process. \\n•  NBFC-ICC and NBFC- MFI will be classified in Base Layer (as their asset size \\nconstitutes less than ₹1000 crore in the example). \\n•  NBFC-P2P and NBFC without public funds and customer interface will, by default, be \\nincluded in the Base Layer. \\nBased on consolidation of assets of all the NBFCs in the Group, the consolidated asset \\nsize of NBFCs in the Group becomes ₹1320 crore (higher than the asset size threshold \\nof ₹1000 crore for classification in Middle Layer). As such, NBFC-ICC and NBFC-MFI will \\nbe classified in the Middle Layer. HFC and IFC will continue to be classified in the Middle \\nLayer in this example. However, NBFC-P2P and NBFC without public funds and customer \\ninterface will continue to be classified in the Base Layer. \\nExample 2 - If the asset size of NBFC-ICC in the above example is ₹10 crore, then would \\nit be still classified in Middle Layer? \\nExplanation - Yes, both NBFC -ICC and NBFC -MFI would still be classified in Middle \\nLayer as the consolidated asset size of NBFCs in the Group at ₹1030 crore is higher than \\nthe asset size threshold of ₹1000 crore for Middle Layer.'),\n",

The ACB should approve the classification of \\naccounts that are past due beyond 90 days but not treated as impaired, with the rationale \\nfor the same clearly documented. Further, the number of such accounts and the total \\namount outstanding and the overdue amounts should be disclosed in the notes to the \\nfinancial statements. \\n1.5  Regardless of the way in which the NBFC assesses significant increase in credit \\nrisk, there is a rebuttable presumption under Ind AS 109 that the credit risk on a financial \\nasset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are \\nmore than 30 days past due. Ind AS 109 also permits that an NBFC can rebut this \\npresumption if it has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates that the \\ncredit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition even though the \\ncontractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

However, there is a rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later than when a financial asset \\nis 90 days past due unless an entity has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion \\nis more appropriate.

The CDR Mechanism is an organizational framework \\ninstitutionalized for speedy disposal of restructuring proposals of large borrowers availing \\nfinance from more than one bank/FI. This mechanism shall be available to all borrowers \\nengaged in any type of activity subject to the following conditions: \\n(i) The borrowers enjoy credit facilities from more than one bank/FI under multiple \\nbanking/syndication/consortium system of lending. \\n(ii) The total outstanding (fund- based and non- fund based) exposure is ₹10 crore or \\nabove. \\nCDR system in the country shall have a three-tier structure: \\n•    CDR Standing Forum and its Core Group \\n•    CDR Empowered Group \\n•    CDR Cell \\n2.

The debtors shall have to accede to the DCA, either at the time of \\noriginal loan documentation (for future cases) or at the time of reference to Corporate \\nDebt Restructuring Cell. Similarly, all participants in the CDR mechanism through their \\nmembership of the Standing Forum shall have to enter into a legally binding agreement, \\nwith necessary enforcement and penal clauses, to operate the System through laid-down \\npolicies and guidelines. The ICA signed by the creditors shall be initially valid for a period \\nof three years and subject to renewal for further periods of three  years thereafter. The \\nlenders in foreign currency outside the country are not a part of CDR system. Such \\ncreditors and also creditors like GIC, LIC, UTI, etc., who have not joined the CDR system, \\ncould join CDR mechanism of a particular corporate by signing transaction to transaction \\nICA, wherever they have exposure to such corporate. \\n5.3.2  The Inter-Creditor Agreement shall be a legally binding agreement amongst the \\ncreditors, with necessary enforcement and penal clauses, wherein the creditors shall \\ncommit themselves to abide by the various elements of CDR system. Further, the \\ncreditors shall agree that if 75 percent of creditors by value and 60 percent of the creditors \\nby number, agree to a restructuring package of an existing debt (i.e., debt outstanding), \\nthe same shall be binding on the remaining creditors. Since Category 1 CDR Scheme \\ncovers only standard and substandard accounts, which in the opinion of 75 percent of the \\ncreditors by value and 60 percent of creditors by number, are likely to become performing \\nafter introduction of the CDR package, it is expected that all other creditors (i.e., those \\noutside the minimum 75 percent by value and 60 percent by number) shall be willing to \\nparticipate in the entire CDR package, including the agreed additional financing. \\n5.3.3  In order to improve effectiveness of the CDR mechanism a clause shall be \\nincorporated in the loan agreements involving consortium/syndicate accounts whereby \\nall creditors, including those which are not members of the CDR mechanism, agree to be \\nbound by the terms of the restructuring package that shall be approved under the CDR \\nmechanism, as and when restructuring may become necessary.'),\n",

Corrective Action Plan (CAP) by JLF \\n2.1 The JLF may explore various options to resolve the stress in the account. The \\nintention is not to encourage a particular resolution option, e.g. restructuring or recovery, \\nbut to arrive at an early and feasible solution to preserve the economic value of the \\nunderlying assets as well as the lenders’ loans. The options under CAP by the JLF shall \\ngenerally include: \\n2.1.1  Rectification - Obtaining a specific commitment from the borrower to regularise \\nthe account so that the account comes out of SMA status or does not slip into the NPA \\ncategory. The commitment shall be supported with identifiable cash flows within the \\nrequired time period and without involving any loss or sacrifice on the part of the existing \\nlenders. If the existing promoters are not in a position to bring in additional money or take \\nany measures to regularise the account, the possibility of getting some other \\nequity/strategic investors to the company may be explored by the JLF in consultation with \\nthe borrower. These measures are intended to turn- around the entity/company without \\nany change in terms and conditions of the loan. The JLF may also consider providing \\nneed based additional fi nance to the borrower, if considered necessary, as part of the \\nrectification process. However, it shall be strictly ensured that additional financing is not \\nprovided with a view to evergreening the account. \\n2.1.2  Restructuring - Consider the possibility of restructuring the account if it is prima \\nfacie viable and there is no diversion of funds, fraud or malfeasance, etc. At this stage, \\ncommitment from promoters for extending their personal guarantees along with their net \\nworth statement supported by copies of legal titles to assets may be obtained along with \\na declaration that they shall not undertake any transaction that shall alienate assets \\nwithout the permission of the JLF. Any deviation from the commitment by the borrowers \\naffecting the security/recoverability of the loans may be treated as a valid factor for \\ninitiating recovery process. For this action to be sustainable, the lenders in the JLF may \\nsign an Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA) and also require the borrower to sign the Debtor \\nCreditor Agreement  (DCA) which shall provide the legal basis for any restructuring \\nprocess. The formats used by the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) mechanism for \\nICA and DCA could be considered, if necessary with appropriate changes.

However, if the JLF decides to proceed with recovery, the minimum \\ncriteria for binding decision, if any, under any relevant laws/Acts would be applicable. \\n2.3 The JLF is required to arrive at an agreement on the option to be adopted for \\nCAP within 30 days from (i) the date of an account being reported as SMA -2 by one or \\nmore lender, or (ii) receipt of request from the borrower to form a JLF, with substantiated \\ngrounds, if it senses imminent stress.

Other Issues/Conditions Relating to Restructuring by JLF/CDR Cell \\n4.1 Both under JLF and CDR mechanism, the restructuring package shall also \\nstipulate the timeline during which certain viability milestones (e.g. improvement in certain \\nfinancial ratios after a period of time, say, 6 months or 1 year and so on) would be \\nachieved. The JLF must periodically review the account for achievement/non-\\nachievement of m ilestones and shall consider initiating suitable measures including \\nrecovery measures as deemed appropriate. \\n4.2 Restructuring whether under JLF or CDR is to be completed within the specified \\ntime periods. The JLF and CDR Cell shall optimally utilise the s pecified time periods so \\nthat the aggregate time limit is not breached under any mode of restructuring. If the \\nJLF/CDR takes a shorter time for an activity as against the prescribed limit, then it can \\nhave the discretion to utilise the saved time for other  activities provided the aggregate \\ntime limit is not breached. \\n4.3 The general principle of restructuring shall be that the shareholders bear the first \\nloss rather than the debt holders. With this principle in view and also to ensure more ‘skin \\nin the game’ of promoters, JLF/CDR may consider the following options when a loan is \\nrestructured: \\n(i) Possibility of transferring equity of the company by promoters to the lenders to \\ncompensate for their sacrifices; \\n(ii) Promoters infusing more equity into their companies; \\n(iii) Transfer of the promoters’ holdings to a security trustee or an escrow arrangement till \\nturnaround of company. This shall enable a change in management control, should \\nlenders favour it.'),\n",

In such cases, the restructuring agreement shall \\nnot incorporate any right of recompense clause. However, if the lenders’ sacrifice is not \\nfully compensated by way of issuance of equities, the right of recompense clause may be \\nincorporated to the extent of shortfall. For unlisted companies, the JLF shall have option \\nof either getting equities issued or incorporate suitable ‘right to recompense’ clause. \\n4.6 In order to distinguish the differential security interest available to secured \\nlenders, partially secured lenders and unsecured lenders, the JLF/CDR could consider \\nvarious options like: \\n(i)  Prior agreement in the ICA among the above classes of lenders regarding repayments, \\nsay, as per an agreed waterfall mechanism; \\n(ii)  A structured agreement stipulating priority of secured creditors; \\n(iii) Appropriation of repayment proceeds among secured, partially secured and \\nunsecured lenders in certain pre-agreed proportion. \\nThe above is only an illustrative list and the JLF may decide on a mutually agreed option. \\nIt also needs to be emphasised that while one lender may have a better security interest \\nwhen it comes to one bor rower, the case may be vice versa in the case of another \\nborrower. So, it shall be beneficial if lenders appreciate the concerns of fellow lenders \\nand arrive at a mutually agreed option with a view to preserving the economic value of \\nassets. Once an option is agreed upon, the lender having the largest exposure may take \\nthe lead in ensuring distribution according to agreed terms once the restructuring package \\nis implemented.'),\n",

It should maintain an ongoing presence in its chosen \\nfunding markets and strong relationships with fund providers to promote effective \\ndiversification of funding sources. An NBFC should regularly gauge its capaci ty to raise \\nfunds quickly from each source. There should not be over -reliance on a single source of \\nfunding.

Managing Interest Rate Risk (IRR) \\n7.1 The operational flexibility given to NBFCs in pricing most of the assets and \\nliabilities imply the need for the financial system to hedge the Interest Rate Risk. Interest \\nrate risk is the risk where changes in market interest rates might adversely affect an \\nNBFC's financial condition. The changes in interest rates affect NBFCs in a larger way . \\nThe immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on NBFC's earnings (i.e. reported \\nprofits) by changing its Net Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changing interest \\nrates is on NBFC's Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net Worth as the economic value of \\nNBFC's assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions get affected due to variation in \\nmarket interest rates. The interest rate risk when viewed from these two perspectives is \\nknown as ‘earnings perspective’ and ‘economic value perspective', respectively. The risk \\nfrom the earnings perspective can be measured as changes in the Net Interest Income \\n(NII) or Net Interest Margin (NIM). There are many analytical techniques for measurement \\nand management of Interest Rate Risk. To begin with, the T raditional Gap A nalysis is \\nconsidered as a suitable method to measure the Interest Rate Risk in the first place. It is \\n \\n72 Less than one year\"),\n",

Gap analysis measures mismatches between rate \\nsensitive liabilities and rate sensitive assets (including off-balance sheet positions). An \\nasset or liability is normally classified as rate sensitive if: \\n(i) within the time interval under consideration, there is a cash flow;  \\n(ii) the interest rate resets/reprices contractually during the interval; \\n(iii) dependent on changes of the Reserve Bank in the interest rates/Bank Rate; \\n(iv) it is contractually pre-payable or withdrawal before the stated maturities. \\n7.3 The Gap Report shall be generated by grouping rate sensitive liabilities, assets \\nand off-balance sheet positions into time buckets according to residual maturity or next \\nrepricing period, whichever is earlier. The difficult task in Gap analysis is determining rate \\nsensitivity. All investments, advances, deposits, borrowings, purchased funds, etc. that \\nmature/reprice within a specified timeframe are interest rate sensitive. Similarly, any \\nprincipal repayment of loan is also rate sensitive if the NBFC expects  to receive it within \\nthe time horizon. This includes final principal payment and interim instalments. Certain \\nassets and liabilities to receive/pay rates that vary with a reference rate. These assets \\nand liabilities are repriced at pre- determined intervals and are rate sensitive at the time \\nof repricing. While the interest rates on term deposits are fixed during their currency, the \\ntranches of advances portfolio are  basically floating. The interest rates on advances \\nreceived could be repriced any number of  occasions, corresponding to the changes in \\nPrime Lending Rate (PLR).  \\n7.4 The Gaps may be identified in the following time buckets: \\n(i) 1 day to 7 days \\n(ii) 8 days to 14 days \\n(iii) 15 days -30/ 31 days (one month) \\n(iv) Over one month to 2 months \\n(v) Over two months to 3 months'),\n",

The Gap reports indicate whether the institution is in a position to benefit from \\nrising interest rates by having a positive Gap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a position to \\nbenefit from declining interest rates by a negative Gap (RSL > RSA).

Introduction \\n1.1. 'Outsourcing' is defined as the NBFC’s use of a third party (either an affiliated \\nentity within a corporate group or an entity that is external to the corporate group) to \\nperform activities on a continuing basis that would normally be undertaken by the NBF C \\nitself, now or in the future.  \\n‘Continuing basis' includes agreements for a limited period. \\n1.2. NBFCs have been outsourcing various activities and are hence exposed to \\nvarious risks as detailed in paragraph 5.3. Further, the outsourced activities are to be \\nbrought within regulatory purview to a) protect the interest of the customers of NBFCs \\nand b) to ensure that the concerned NBFC and the Reserve Bank have access to all \\nrelevant books, records and information available with service provider. Typically \\noutsourced financial services include applications processing (loan origination, credit \\ncard), document processing, marketing and research, supervision of loans, data \\nprocessing and back office related activities, besides others. \\n1.3. Some key risks in outsourcing ar e Strategic Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance \\nRisk, Operational Risk, Legal Risk, Exit Strategy Risk, Counterparty Risk, Country Risk, \\nContractual Risk, Access Risk, Concentration and Systemic Risk. The failure of a service \\nprovider in providing a specifie d service, a breach in security/confidentiality, or non-\\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements by the service provider can lead to \\nfinancial losses or loss of reputation for the NBFC and could also lead to systemic risks.  \\n1.4. It is therefore imperative for the NBFC outsourcing its activities to ensure sound \\nand responsive risk management practices for effective oversight, due diligence and \\nmanagement of risks arising from such outsourced activities. The instruc tions are \\napplicable to material outsourcing arrangements as explained in paragraph 3 which may \\nbe entered into by an NBFC with a service provider located in India or elsewhere. The \\nservice provider may either be a member of the group/conglomerate to which the NBFC \\nbelongs, or an unrelated party.\"),\n",

The underlying principles behind these instruc tions are that the regulated entity \\nshall ensure that outsourcing arrangements neither diminish its ability to fulfil its \\nobligations to customers and the Reserve Bank  nor impede effective supervision by the  \\nReserve Bank. NBFCs, therefore, have to take steps to ensure that the service provider \\nemploys the same high standard of care in performing the services as is expected to be \\nemployed by the NBFCs, if the activities were conducted within the NBFCs and not \\noutsourced. Accordingly, NBFCs shall not engage in outsourcing that would result in their \\ninternal control, business conduct or reputation being compromised or weakened. \\n1.6. (i) These instructi ons are concerned with managing risks in outsourcing of \\nfinancial services and are not applicable to technology -related issues and activities not \\nrelated to financial services, such as usage of courier, catering of staff, housekeeping and \\njanitorial services, security of the premises, movement and archiving of records, etc. \\nNBFCs which desire to outsource financial services would not require prior approval from \\nthe Reserve Bank . However, such arrangements would be subject to on- site/off-site \\nmonitoring and inspection/scrutiny by the Reserve Bank. \\n (ii) With regard to outsourced services relating to credit cards, detailed \\ninstructions of the Reserve Bank contained in \\n‘Master Direction – Credit Card and Debit \\nCard – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022’, dated April 21, 2022, as  amended from \\ntime to time, would be applicable. \\n2. Activities that shall not be outsourced \\nNBFCs which choose to outsource financial services shall, however, not outsource core \\nmanagement functions including Internal Audit, Strategic and Compliance functions and \\ndecision-making functions such as determining compliance with KYC norms for opening \\ndeposit accounts, according sanction for loans (including retail loans) and management \\nof investment portfolio . However, for NBFCs in a group/conglomerate, these functions \\nmay be outsourced within the group subject to compliance with instructions in paragraph \\n6. Further, w hile internal audit function itself is a management process, the internal \\nauditors can be on contract.'),\n",

Material Outsourcing \\nFor the purpose of these instruc tions, material outsourcing arrangements are those \\nwhich, if disrupted, have the potential to significantly impact the business operations, \\nreputation, profitability or customer service. Materiality of outsourcing would be based on: \\n(i) the level of importance to the NBFC of the activity being outsourced as well as the \\nsignificance of the risk posed by the same; \\n(ii)  the potential impact of the outsourcing on the NBFC on various parameters such as \\nearnings, solvency, liquidity, funding capital and risk profile; \\n(iii) the likely impact on the NBFC’s reputation and brand value, and ability to achieve its \\nbusiness objectives, strategy and pl ans, should the service provider fail to perform the \\nservice; \\n(iv) the cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs of the NBFC; \\n(v)  the aggregate exposure to that particular service provider, in cases where the NBFC \\noutsources various functions to the same service provider and \\n(vi) the significance of activities outsourced in context of customer service and protection. \\n4. NBFC's role and Regulatory and Supervisory Requirements \\n4.1 The outsourcing of any activity by NBFC does not diminish its obligations, and \\nthose of its Board and senior management, who have the ultimate responsibility for the \\noutsourced activity. NBFCs would therefore be responsible for the actions of their service \\nprovider including Direct Sales Agents/Direct Marketing Agents and recovery agents and \\nthe confidentiality of information pertaining to the customers that is available with the \\nservice provider. NBFCs shall retain ultimate control of the outsourced activity. \\n4.2 It is imperative for the NBFC, when performing its due diligence in relation to \\noutsourcing, to consider all relevant laws, regulations, guidelines and conditions of \\napproval, licensing or registration. \\n4.3 Outsourcing arrangements shall not affect the rights of a customer against the \\nNBFC, including the ability of the customer to obtain redress as applicable under relevant \\nlaws. In cases where the customers are required to deal with the service providers in the \\nprocess of dealing with the NBFC, NBFCs shall incorporate a clause in the relative \\nproduct literature/brochures, etc., st ating that they may use the services of agents in \\nsales/marketing etc. of the products. The role of agents may be indicated in broad terms.\"),\n",

Nevertheless, there are certain assets that are more likely to \\ngenerate funds without incurring large discounts due to fire-sales even in times of stress.  \\n4.2 The fundamental characteristics of HQLAs include low credit and market risk; \\nease and certainty of valuation; low correlation with risky assets and listing on a \\ndeveloped and recognized exchange market. The market related characteristics of \\nHQLAs include active and sizeable market; presence of committed market makers; low \\nmarket concentration and flight to quality (tendencies to move into these types of assets \\nin a systemic crisis). \\n4.3 Assets to be included in the computation of HQLAs are those that the NBFC is \\nholding on the first day of the stress period. Such assets shall be valued at an amount no \\ngreater than their current market value for the purpose of computing the LCR. Depending \\nupon the nature of assets, they have been assigned different haircuts below, which are \\nto be applied while calculating the HQLA for the purpose of calculation of LCR.

Total net cash outflows  \\n5.1 Total net cash outflows is defined as the total expected cash outflows minus total \\nexpected cash inflows for the subsequent 30 calendar days. Considering the unique \\nnature of the balance sheet of the NBFCs, stressed cash flows is computed by assigning \\na predefined stress percentage to the overall cash inflows and cash outflows. Total \\nexpected cash outflows (stressed outflows) are calculated by multiplying the outstanding \\nbalances of various categories or types of liabilities and off -balance sheet commitments \\nby 115 percent (15 percent being the rate at which they are expected to run off further or \\nbe drawn down). Total expected cash inflows (stressed inflows) are calculated by \\nmultiplying the outstanding balances of various categories of contractual receivables by \\n75 percent (25 percent being the rate at which they are expected to under-flow). However, \\ntotal cash inflows will be subjected to an aggregate cap of 75  percent of total expected \\ncash outflows.

LCR Disclosure Standards  \\n6.1 NBFCs are required to disclose information on their LCR every quarter. Further, \\nNBFCs in their annual financial statements under Notes to Accounts, starting with the \\nfinancial year ending March 31, 2021, shall disclose information on LCR for all the four \\nquarters of the relevant financial year.

Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) \\nThe Boards of NBFCs shall constitute a Nomination and Remuneration Committee \\n(NRC). The NRC shall have the constitution, powers, functions and duties as laid down \\nin section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013. The NRC,  inter alia,  shall also have the \\nmandate to oversee the framing, review and implementation of compensation policy of \\nthe company which should have the approval of the board. The NRC may work in close \\ncoordination with Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the company to achieve \\neffective alignment between compensation and risks. Further, the NRC may ensure that \\ncompensation levels are supported by the need to retain earnings of the company and \\nthe need to maintain adequate capital based on ICAAP. NRC may also ensure ‘fit and \\nproper’ status of proposed/existing directors and that there is no conflict of interest in \\nappointment of directors on Board of the company, KMPs and senior management. \\n2.  Principles for compensation \\n2.1 Components and risk alignment:  The compensation of Key Managerial \\nPersonnel (KMPs) and senior management needs to be reasonable, recognising all  \\nrelevant factors including adherence to statutory requirements and industry practices. The \\ncompensation packages may comprise of fixed and variable pay components aligned \\neffectively with prudent risk taking to ensure that compensation is adjusted for all  types \\nof risks, the compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes, compensation \\npay-outs are sensitive to the time horizon of the risks, and the mix of cash, equity and \\nother forms of compensation are consistent with risk alignment. \\n2.2 Composition of Fixed Pay:  All the fixed items of compensation, including the \\nperquisites and contributions towards superannuation/retiral benefits, may be treated as \\npart of fixed pay. All perquisites that are reimbursable may also be included in the fixed'),\n",

Monetary \\nequivalent of benefits of non- monetary nature (such as free furnished house, use of \\ncompany car, etc.) may also be part of fixed pay. \\n2.3 Principles for Variable Pay \\n2.3.1 Composition of Variable Pay:  The variable pay may be in the form of share-\\nlinked instruments, or a mix of cash and share-linked instruments. It shall be ensured that \\nthe share-linked instruments are in conformity with relevant statutory provisions. \\n2.3.2 Proportion: The proportion of variable pay in total compensation 90 needs to be \\ncommensurate with the role and prudent risk taking profile of KMPs/senior management. \\nAt higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay needs to be higher. There \\nshould be proper balance between the cash and share-linked instruments in the variable \\npay in case the variable pay contains share linked instruments. The variable pay should \\nbe truly and effectively variable and can be reduced to zero based on performance at an \\nindividual, business -unit and company -wide level. In order to do so, performance \\nmeasures and their relation to remuneration packages should be clearly defined at the \\nbeginning of the performance measurement period to ensure that the employees perceive \\nthe incentive mechanism. \\n2.3.3 Deferral of variable pay:  Not all the variable pay awarded after performance \\nassessment may be paid immediately. Certain portion of variable pay, as decided by the \\nBoard of the company, may be deferred to time horizon of the risks. The portion of deferral \\narrangement may be made applicable for both cash and non- cash components of the \\nvariable pay. Deferral period for such an arrangement may be decided by the Board of \\nthe company. \\n2.3.4 Control and assurance function personnel:  KMPs and senior management \\nengaged in financial control, risk management, compliance and internal audit may be \\ncompensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas they oversee and \\n \\n90 Total compensation includes fixed and variable pay'),\n",

Guaranteed bonus \\nGuaranteed bonus may not be paid to KMPs and senior management. However, in the \\ncontext of new hiring joining/sign-on bonus could be considered. Such bonus will neither \\nbe considered part of fixed pay nor of variable pay. \\n \\n4. Malus/Clawback \\nThe deferred compensation may be subject to malus 91/clawback92 arrangements in the \\nevent of subdued or negative financial performance of the company and/or the relevant \\nline of business or employee misconduct in any year. A representative set of situations \\nmay be identified by the NBFC, which require them to invoke the malus and clawback \\nclauses that may be applicable on entire variable pay. While setting criteria for the \\napplication of malus and clawback, NBFCs may also specify a period during which malus \\nand/or clawback can be applied, covering at least the deferral and retention periods93. \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n91 A malus arrangement permits the NBFC to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration.

      "1. Correctness: The submission states that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does not guarantee the repayment of the deposits collected by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), which is a correct statement. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, upon closer examination, it mentions that \"As per RBI guidelines, NBFCs are not deposit-taking institutions and do not accept deposits, except for certain permitted exceptions.\" This statement might not be entirely accurate because NBFCs are indeed authorized to collect deposits, though they are not guaranteed by the RBI. This discrepancy may lead to inaccuracies in understanding the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The submission also mentions Section 5(b) and Section 45-I(c) of the RBI Act, 1934, which excludes NBFCs from the definition of 'banking company'. While this is true, it may not directly relate to the main point that the RBI does not guarantee the repayment of deposits by NBFCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, it discusses provision 74, which seems to mention investments in fixed deposits and interest income on fixed deposits. This provision appears to be unrelated to the main point and could be seen as an attempt to provide additional context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these points, the submission may be partially correct but also contains inaccuracies and unrelated information. The main point of the submission, however, is still correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Accuracy: The submission's accuracy is affected by its inclusion of unrelated information and the mention of specific sections of the RBI Act, 1934, without a clear connection to the main point.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Factual: The submission appears to be based on factual information, such as the RBI Act, 1934, and provision 74. However, its inclusion of unrelated information may affect its overall factual accuracy.\n",

      "What precautions have to be taken by the public to forewarn themselves about the likelihood of losing money in schemes that offer high rates of interest?\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct Answer:\n",
      "Before investing in schemes that promise high rates of return, the depositors/ investors must ensure that the entity offering such returns is registered with one of the Financial Sector Regulators and is authorized to accept funds, whether in the form of deposits or otherwise. Depositors/ investors must generally be circumspect if the interest rates or rates of return on deposits/ investments offered are high. Unless the entity accepting funds is able to earn more than what it promises, the entity will not be able to repay the depositor/ investor as promised. For earning higher returns, the entity will have to take higher risks on the investments it makes. Higher the risk, the more speculative would be its investments on which there can be no assured return. As such, members of public should forewarn themselves that the likelihood of losing money in schemes that offer high rates of interest are more.\n",

      "Bot's Response:\n",
      "The public can take the following precautions to forewarn themselves about the likelihood of losing money in schemes that offer high rates of interest:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Be cautious of unusually high interest rates and returns that seem too good to be true.\n",
      "* Verify the credentials and licenses of the company or individual offering the scheme.\n",
      "* Ensure that the scheme is registered with the relevant regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n",
      "* Check for any warnings or notices issued by the regulatory authorities regarding the scheme or the company.\n",
      "* Research the company's history, reputation, and past performance.\n",
      "* Understand the terms and conditions of the scheme, including the risks involved and the potential for capital loss.\n",
      "* Do not invest in schemes that are not transparent about their operations, fees, and risks.\n",
      "* Be wary of schemes that promise guaranteed returns or high returns with little or no risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, the RBI has issued guidelines cautioning the public against investments in schemes that offer unusually high returns. According to the RBI, investments that promise unusually high returns or are not transparent about their operations, fees, and risks should be treated with skepticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the RBI has emphasized the importance of due diligence and caution when dealing with schemes that offer high interest rates. The RBI has recommended that investors should:\n",

      "* Understand the terms and conditions of the scheme, including the risks involved and the potential for capital loss.\n",

      "1. **Correctness**: \n",
      "The submission provides a comprehensive list of precautions that the public should take to forewarn themselves about the likelihood of losing money in schemes that offer high rates of interest. The information is accurate and factual, and it cites the RBI as a reference, which adds credibility to the submission. However, upon closer inspection, I found that the submission contains information that is not present in the reference, such as the specific guidelines from the RBI regarding unusually high returns and the importance of due diligence and caution.\n",

      "2. **Accuracy**: \n",
      "The submission accurately conveys the message that schemes offering high rates of interest may be risky and that the public should be cautious. It also mentions the importance of verifying credentials, researching the company's history, and understanding the terms and conditions of the scheme. These points are all accurate and supported by the reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the submission does include some information that is not directly supported by the reference, such as the specific guidelines from the RBI regarding unusually high returns. Therefore, I would say that the submission meets the accuracy criterion to some extent, but not fully.\n",

      "3. **Factualness**: \n",
      "The submission is largely factual, citing the RBI as a reference and providing accurate information about the importance of due diligence and caution when dealing with schemes that offer high interest rates. However, it includes some information that is not directly supported by the reference, which may be considered non-factual.\n",

      "What constitutes Commercial Real Estate exposure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct Answer:\n",
      "Commercial Real Estate (CRE) would consist of loans to builders/ developers/ others for creation/ acquisition of commercial real estate (such as office building, retail space, multi-purpose commercial premises, multi-tenanted commercial premises, industrial or warehouse space, hotels, land acquisition, development and construction etc.) where the prospects for repayment, or recovery in case of default, would depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset by way of lease/rental payments, sale etc. Further, loans for third dwelling unit onwards to an individual will be treated as CRE exposure. Exposure shall also include non-fund based limits. Commercial Real Estate – Residential Housing (CRE–RH) is a sub-category of CRE that consist of loans to builders/ developers for residential housing projects (except for captive consumption). Such projects should ordinarily not include non-residential commercial real estate. However integrated housing project comprising of some commercial spaces (e.g., shopping complex, school etc.) can also be specified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10 percent of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceed the ceiling of 10 percent, the entire loan should be classified as CRE and not CRE-RH.\n",

      "Question Asked:\n",
      "What does conducting financial activity as “principal business” mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct Answer:\n",
      "Financial activity as principal business is when a company’s financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the total assets (netted off by intangible assets) and income from financial assets constitute more than 50 per cent of the gross income. A company which fulfils both these criteria needs to get registered as NBFC with the Reserve Bank. The term 'principal business' has not been defined in the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. Hence, the Reserve Bank has defined it vide Press Release 1998-99/1269 dated April 08, 1999 so as to ensure that only companies predominantly engaged in financial activity get registered with it and are regulated and supervised by it. Hence, if there are companies engaged in agricultural operations, industrial activity, purchase and sale of goods, providing services or purchase, sale or construction of immovable property as their principal business and are doing some financial business in a small way, they will not be regulated by the Reserve Bank. Interestingly, this test is popularly known as 50-50 test and is applied to determine whether or not a company is into financial business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bot's Response:\n",
      "For the purpose of determining whether a company is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) considers the concept of \"principal business\". According to the RBI, a company is treated as an NBFC if its financial assets are more than 50 percent of its total assets (netted off by intangible assets) and income from financial assets is more than 50 percent of its gross income.\n",
      "\n",
      "This criterion is outlined in the Principal Business Criteria, which is based on the Press Release 1998-99/1269 dated April 08, 1999. According to this, a company will be treated as an NBFC if it meets both the asset test and the income test. This means that the company's primary focus or business activity is in the area of financial services, such as lending, investment, or other financial activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple terms, conducting financial activity as \"principal business\" means that the company's primary business is in the financial sector, and a significant portion of its assets and income come from financial activities. This can include activities such as providing loans, making investments, or offering other financial products or services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please refer to RBI's circular No. RBI/1998-99/1269 dated April 08, 1999 for more information on this topic.\n",

      "To determine if the submission meets the criteria, I will break down the assessment into steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Correctness of the Definition\n",
      "- The submission provides a definition of conducting financial activity as \"principal business\" in relation to NBFC classification.\n",
      "- The definition includes the asset test and income test as outlined in the Principal Business Criteria.\n",
      "- However, it does not explicitly mention that these tests are based on the 50% threshold (more than 50% of total assets and gross income).\n",
      "- It also does not clarify that the term \"principal business\" is not defined in the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and is defined by the RBI through the Press Release 1998-99/1269 dated April 08, 1999.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Accuracy of the Reference\n",
      "- The submission correctly cites RBI's circular No. RBI/1998-99/1269 dated April 08, 1999, as the reference for the Principal Business Criteria.\n",
      "- However, it does not provide the actual text or any relevant information from the circular, which is necessary for a thorough understanding of the topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Factual Information\n",
      "- The submission provides factual information about the RBI's definition of \"principal business\" and its application in NBFC classification.\n",
      "- However, it does not provide enough context or supporting evidence to establish the accuracy of the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the above assessment, I conclude that the submission partially meets the criteria. While it provides a correct definition and cites the relevant reference, it lacks sufficient detail and context to establish its accuracy and completeness.\n",
